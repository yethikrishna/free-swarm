"""The orchestrator's browser-delegation guidance.

BrowserRepeatFlow lives in the browser SUB-agent, but the orchestrator decides
HOW to delegate. If it splits a 'same flow, many items' task into N parallel
sub-agents, each gets one item and RepeatFlow is never reachable. This pins the
guidance that routes such tasks to ONE sub-agent with the whole list, so the
batch path is actually usable (not stranded behind the delegation layer).
