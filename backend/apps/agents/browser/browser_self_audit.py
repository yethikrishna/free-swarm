"""
Self-audit loop for the browser agent's own LEARNING (browser memory tier 4).

Tiers 1-3 make the agent better at the WEBSITE. This makes it better at LEARNING:
it reads its own run metrics + skill lifecycle and flags where the learning
machinery is misfiring, skills that re-learn forever but never replay (thrash),
runs that stall (turns far above the site's norm), recurring tool errors, low
route-hint adoption, then writes a PROPOSAL for a human to act on.

SAFETY LINE (deliberate): this NEVER edits prompts, thresholds, or code. In an
open-source local-agent product, an agent silently rewriting its own behavior is
a line we don't cross. It only READS metrics and WRITES a human-readable report;
a person decides what to change. Pure observation in, one proposal file out.
