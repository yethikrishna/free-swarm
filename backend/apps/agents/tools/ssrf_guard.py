"""SSRF guard for the agent's web fetchers.

Blocks fetches that would target private/internal IPs (RFC1918, link-local
incl. cloud metadata, CGNAT, multicast, ULA v6, etc). Resolution is async
(non-blocking) and covers both IPv4 AND IPv6 via getaddrinfo.

Loopback (127/8, ::1) is INTENTIONALLY allowed because the desktop app's App
Builder previews servers on 127.0.0.1:<random> and the agent needs to be able
to verify the built app actually runs. The user owns the loopback surface on
their own machine; the realistic SSRF threat for a desktop app is cloud
metadata (169.254.169.254) + internal corporate LANs, not localhost.
