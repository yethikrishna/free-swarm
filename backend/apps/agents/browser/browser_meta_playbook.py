"""
Cross-site meta-playbook (browser memory tier 3).

Tier 2 (`browser_playbook`) learns per-SITE strategy. This tier learns the
SITE-AGNOSTIC patterns that transfer everywhere, e.g. "a composer clears on send,
so the cleared box IS the confirmation; do not hunt the thread for the text" or
"an opener like Message/DM just opens the box, only Send is irreversible". So the
VERY FIRST task on a brand-new site already benefits from what was learned on
every other site, the generalizable answer to "make it learn to learn".

Cheap by construction: the per-site distill (one aux call we already make) ALSO
returns a `universal` list; we just MERGE those here (dedup + cap), NO extra LLM
call. Same fail-safe as the per-site playbook: it is ADVISORY text seeded into the
prompt and re-verified by the agent, never auto-executed, so a wrong universal
bullet can only mildly mislead and is corrected as more sites confirm the truth.
