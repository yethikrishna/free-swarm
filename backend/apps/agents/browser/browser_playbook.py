"""
Durable, reflective per-site strategy playbook (browser memory tier 2).

Tier 1 (`browser_skills`) REPLAYS mechanical action sequences with zero LLM, the
instant path for deterministic repeats. This tier remembers STRATEGY as text:
"on linkedin, generic 'design engineer' = hardware engineers; search Vercel/
Linear+React instead; the add-a-role wall is fine, read the top card." That can't
be replayed (it's judgment), but seeding it into the next run's prompt lets the
model skip re-discovery, so judgment tasks (find/evaluate/rank) get FASTER and
WISER each time instead of starting cold every run.

Folded from the best OSS, read from source (not guessed):
  - mem0 (`configs/prompts.py`): distill a run into atomic facts, then reconcile
    against existing memory with ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NONE (accumulate + dedup +
    self-correct, never blind-overwrite, never unbounded). We collapse mem0's two
    LLM calls into ONE cheap aux call for cost: hand it the existing bullets + the
    run, get back the reconciled bullet list.
  - Stagehand/Skyvern/Voyager: only learn from a VERIFIED success, self-heal.

Two properties we hold to:
1. FAIL-SAFE: the playbook is ADVISORY TEXT, seeded into the prompt and re-verified
   by the agent, never auto-executed. A wrong bullet can only mislead (and gets
   corrected on the next run's reconcile), never ghost-succeed like a bad skill.
2. CHEAP + PROVIDER-AGNOSTIC: one cheap-tier aux call, only on a substantive
   verified success (rare relative to the work), via the caller's resolved aux
   model. Reads are O(1) disk, no LLM, so seeding stays free.
