"""
Last-resort adjudication for a stuck browser sub-agent.

Deterministic stagnation detection (browser_loop) handles the common cases for
free. When it's exhausted (a run of actions with no progress despite escalating
nudges), we make ONE cheap aux-tier LLM call to suggest a concrete next step.
It is rare by construction, so the cost stays near zero. The model + client are
resolved provider-agnostically by the caller (cheap tier of whatever provider
the user has connected), so nothing here hardcodes Anthropic/Haiku.
