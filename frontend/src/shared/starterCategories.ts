// category, then a concrete prompt. Chosen to SHOWCASE what only FreeSwarm can do, and to
// feel PERSONAL: the agents can see the user's own computer/files, drive the browser, plug
// into their apps (MCPs), build real apps, and run agents in parallel, none of which a plain
// chatbot can do out of the box. Many prompts deliberately touch the user's own stuff so it
// matters to them. One-click-runnable (no [placeholders]); reads plainly for a non-dev.
// target 'app-builder' opens the App Builder (live preview); the rest run as an agent.
