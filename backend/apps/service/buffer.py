"""Bounded SQLite spool for offline operational submissions.

When the desktop is offline (laptop closed, no internet, cloud unreachable),
the service-sync layer can't reach `api.freeswarm.myndlabs.tech`. Rather than drop
data on the floor, we spool submissions to a small SQLite file and replay
them on the next online tick. The spool is bounded; when full, the oldest
entries are dropped; so it can never balloon to a problem.

Single file, single table, single thread guarded by a sqlite3 connection's
implicit lock. No concurrency model beyond "don't write from two processes
at once."
