/**
 * Reliable mount-reveal for elements that should slide+fade in once when they
 * first appear. Returns an sx fragment to spread onto the element.
 *
 * Why this instead of a CSS `@keyframes ... animation`: a mount-time keyframe
 * fires at most once and silently no-ops in several real cases here (Emotion
 * injects the keyframe in the same pass the element mounts; the tool bubble
 * briefly exists as its streaming twin first; a same-frame re-render with the
 * same animation-name won't restart it). That's why tool bubbles read as
 * "appears out of nowhere" while the JS-driven streamed text feels smooth.
 *
 * This is the same robustness class as the text reveal: render hidden, then on
 * the NEXT frame flip to shown with a CSS *transition*. A transition always
 * runs when the property value changes, and the rAF flip guarantees a change
 * after the first paint, so the reveal can't be skipped. Transform+opacity only,
 * so it rides the compositor and never nudges layout or scroll.
