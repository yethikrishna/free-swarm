"""Built-in WebSearch reliability: only an ENTITLED Anthropic endpoint suppresses DDG.

The 401 'Invalid bearer token (reset after ~2m)' comes from the CLI's built-in
WebSearch firing an aux `claude-haiku` call. That call only authenticates when it
reaches an entitled Anthropic endpoint:
  - a DIRECT anthropic api-route model (base_url = api.anthropic.com, user's key), or
  - FreeSwarm Pro (entitled to the managed pool 9Router's anthropic/* resolves to).

A SUBSCRIPTION-route Claude model (opus-4-8, route=None) sends the haiku call
through 9Router to the managed pool, which 401s for non-Pro users, so a bare
anthropic_api_key in settings is NOT enough. Those sessions must keep the free,
always-working DDG fallback instead of a 401-ing hosted path.
