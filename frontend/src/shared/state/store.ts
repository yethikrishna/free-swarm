  // (agent streaming, websocket heartbeats, settings sync). Console warns
  // "SerializableStateInvariantMiddleware took 41ms" repeatedly under load.
  //
  // Production builds skip these middlewares anyway, so disabling them in
  // dev makes dev behavior match prod , no surprises at packaging time.
  // Trade-off: serializability bugs (e.g. accidentally putting a Map or
  // Date directly into state) won't be caught at dev time. We've shipped
  // many versions with stable slice shapes; that risk is now low.
